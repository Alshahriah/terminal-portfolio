# Hey, I'm Al Shahriah! ✌️

Welcome to my corner of the web. This is just a place where I dump my projects and experiment.

## 🕹️ Why I built this?

Honestly? I just wanted to try out some crazy animations and 3D stuff.

It's basically a playground for me to see how far I can push Framer Motion and Three.js without breaking things.

## 🛠️ What's under the hood?

- **Next.js**: My go-to for building stuff fast.
- **Framer Motion**: Makes everything feel smooth and alive.
- **Three.js & R3F**: For that 3D magic.
- **React Flow**: Because I like making maps of things.
- **Lucide Icons**: Clean and simple.

## 🚀 Want to run it?

1. **Grab the code:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-v1.git
   cd portfolio-v1
   ```

2. **Install the goods:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Fire it up:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Head over to `localhost:3000` and enjoy the show.

## ☁️ Hosting

This thing is ready to go on Vercel. Just connect your GitHub repo and you're golden. Standard Next.js settings will work perfectly.
